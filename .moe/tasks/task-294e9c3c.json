      "description": "Create a WrapLayout class that extends FlowLayout and wraps components to the next line when the container is too narrow. This is a standard Swing pattern: override preferredLayoutSize() to calculate height based on actual container width (accounting for wrapping), and override layoutContainer() to position components left-to-right and wrap to the next row when they exceed the container width. Place this in the board package alongside BoardStyles. Include error handling: guard against zero-width containers and null components.",
