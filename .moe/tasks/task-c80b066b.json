      "description": "Fix release.yml job-level secrets access that causes workflow file parse failure. Line 84 uses `if: secrets.JETBRAINS_MARKETPLACE_TOKEN != ''` at the JOB level, but `secrets` context is not resolvable at job-level `if` conditions during workflow parsing, causing the entire workflow to fail to load (0 jobs, 0s, 'workflow file issue'). Fix by removing the job-level `if` and instead adding `if: ${{ env.PUBLISH_TOKEN != '' }}` to the actual publish step (line 108-113), which already sets the env var. This way the job always runs but the publish step is skipped when the secret is missing. Also add proper error handling with `continue-on-error: true` on the step.",
