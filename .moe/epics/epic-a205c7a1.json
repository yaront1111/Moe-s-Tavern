  "description": "Comprehensive improvements to make AI agents smarter, more autonomous, and better at writing high-quality code. Covers: role documentation, constraint system, feedback loops, context delivery, and missing tools.",
  "architectureNotes": "Focus areas: (1) Rich role docs with error handling, testing, and code quality guidance. (2) Populated global rails for enforcement. (3) Better context delivery (worker self-awareness, task history). (4) Structured feedback (QA rejections, step notes). (5) Missing tools (activity log, worker status). All changes must be backward-compatible with existing agents.",
  "epicRails": [
    "Role docs must be concise enough for system prompt injection (<200 lines)",
    "All new MCP tools must have tests in tools.test.ts",
    "Changes must not break existing agent scripts or MCP protocol",
    "Global rails must avoid false positives (e.g. 'any' matching 'many')"
